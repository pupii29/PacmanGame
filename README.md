<h3>b) Discribe topic:</h3>
<p> And our topic is the Pacman game. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective      of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that          pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when      all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has their own unique, distinct artificial intelligence (A.I.), or "personalities"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man,      Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.</p>
   
<h3>c) Moviation:</h3>
<p>Pac-man is a game that all of our members play when they first come into contact with the Internet. And we all love this game so much that we decided to choose this game as a project for OOP.</p>

 <h2>II) Technology stack selection</h2>
 <p>Because this is a fairly basic game, we used Java programming language and 2 Frameworks JavaSwing and JavaAWT. These are all the knowledge we have gained through this course.<br>
 
 <strong><i>JavaAWT:</i></strong><br>
 
Java AWT is an API that contains a large number of classes and methods to create and manage graphical user interface ( GUI ) applications. The AWT was designed to provide a common set of tools for GUI design that could work on a variety of platforms. The tools provided by the AWT are implemented using each platform's native GUI toolkit, hence preserving the look and feel of each platform. This is an advantage of using AWT. But the disadvantage of such an approach is that GUI designed on one platform may look different when displayed on another platform which means AWT components are platform dependent.

AWT is the foundation upon which Swing is made i.e Swing is an improved GUI API that extends the AWT. But nowadays AWT is merely used because most GUI Java programs are implemented using Swing because of its rich implementation of GUI controls and light-weighted nature.<br>
 
<strong><i>JavaSwing:</i></strong><br>
 
Java Swing is a GUI Framework that contains a set of classes to provide more powerful and flexible GUI components than AWT. Swing provides the look and feel of modern Java GUI. Swing library is an official Java GUI tool kit released by Sun Microsystems. It is used to create graphical user interface with Java.

Swing classes are defined in javax.swing package and its sub-packages.<br></p>
