<h2>I) Introduction <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/right.gif"></h2>
 <p><h3>a) Team: <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/ghost.gif"></h3>
   Our team's name is CHVN (Can, Hung, Vinh, Nam) and these are our nembers:
      <ol><li>Mai Lê Hùng - ITITIU19125 (team leader)</li>
      <li>Nguyễn Cần  - ITITIU20171</li>
      <li>Huỳnh Văn Vĩnh  - ITITIU19248</li>

<h3>b) Discribe topic: <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/ghost.gif"></h3>
<p> And our topic is the Pacman game. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective      of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that          pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when      all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has their own unique, distinct artificial intelligence (A.I.), or "personalities"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man,      Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.</p>
   
<h3>c) Moviation: <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/ghost.gif"></h3>
<p>Pac-man is a game that all of our members play when they first come into contact with the Internet. And we all love this game so much that we decided to choose this game as a project for OOP.</p>

 <h2>II) Technology stack selection <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/right.gif"></h2>
 <p>Because this is a fairly basic game, we used Java programming language and 2 Frameworks JavaSwing and JavaAWT. These are all the knowledge we have gained through this course.<br>
 
 <strong><i>JavaAWT:</i></strong><br>
 
Java AWT is an API that contains a large number of classes and methods to create and manage graphical user interface ( GUI ) applications. The AWT was designed to provide a common set of tools for GUI design that could work on a variety of platforms. The tools provided by the AWT are implemented using each platform's native GUI toolkit, hence preserving the look and feel of each platform. This is an advantage of using AWT. But the disadvantage of such an approach is that GUI designed on one platform may look different when displayed on another platform which means AWT components are platform dependent.

AWT is the foundation upon which Swing is made i.e Swing is an improved GUI API that extends the AWT. But nowadays AWT is merely used because most GUI Java programs are implemented using Swing because of its rich implementation of GUI controls and light-weighted nature.<br>
 
<strong><i>JavaSwing:</i></strong><br>
 
Java Swing is a GUI Framework that contains a set of classes to provide more powerful and flexible GUI components than AWT. Swing provides the look and feel of modern Java GUI. Swing library is an official Java GUI tool kit released by Sun Microsystems. It is used to create graphical user interface with Java.

Swing classes are defined in javax.swing package and its sub-packages.<br></p>

<h2>V) Our challenges <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/right.gif"></h2>
<p>For some of the team members, this was the first time they worked on a programming project together, so there were a lot of difficulties we had to overcome in the process of working on this project. The first is knowledge because this is a basic and important subject in programming, so before learning this subject, our knowledge of programming is still very limited. Therefore, absorbing such a large amount of knowledge creates many difficulties for us. After that, apply the knowledge learned to make this game. Because the knowledge is still very new, we have not fully grasped it yet, so we have to use it to work on the project, so this is also a huge challenge for us. At the same time, to work together on the internet, we had to learn how to use GitHub and the Readme file to make reports, which caused a lot of difficulties and confusion for our team. And our last difficulty is having to work in a team, this difficulty comes from our ability to communicate, lead, divide work,... After all the above difficulties we finally finished our project although there are some features that we still can't complete for the game.</p><br>

<h2>VI) Result and conclusion <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/right.gif"></h2>
<p>We finally made the pacman game with our own strength. It is thanks to a lot of our knowledge that we have learned through this OOP subject such as Object, Overriding, Java swing,... Finally, we would like to conclude that OOP is indeed a very useful subject. Useful and necessary for all IT students. At the same time, we would like to thank Mr. Thong for his support during OOP learning</p>

<h2>VII) What have we learn <img src="https://github.com/pupii29/PacmanGame/blob/main/images/right.gif"></h2>
<p>We have learned many things through this course. The first is the object-oriented Java programming language. Followed by Frameworks such as JavaAWT, JavaSwing,... At the same time, there is much other knowledge about GUI too. In addition, we also learned skills to use Github to do our projects. At the same time, thanks to having to make a Readme file, we also have quite a bit of knowledge about HTML. Finally, the skill of teamwork is one of the extremely necessary skills in the future work that we have learned through this subject. To achieve the above achievements, we are very grateful for the guidance and guidance of the teacher.</p><br>
