   b) Discribe topic:
      And our topic is the Pacman game. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective      of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that          pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when      all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has their own unique, distinct artificial intelligence (A.I.), or "personalities"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man,      Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.
   
   c) Moviation: 
   
      Pac-man is a game that all of our members play when they first come into contact with the Internet. And we all love this game so much that we decided to choose this game as a project for OOP.
